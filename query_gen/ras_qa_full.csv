Extended Thymectomy for Myasthenia Gravis and Thymoma,What technique aids initial trocar insertion in thymectomy for patients with high BMI or during reoperation?,Direct dissection with scissors can be helpful in creating space for the first trocar in cases of narrow or adhesive pleural cavities.
Extended Thymectomy for Myasthenia Gravis and Thymoma,What techniques may assist in dissecting or extracting a large thymoma?,"An additional 5-mm trocar may be inserted for easier dissection, or a subxiphoid incision can be made to extract the specimen."
Extended Thymectomy for Myasthenia Gravis and Thymoma,Why should the contralateral right pleural cavity remain intact during CO2 insufflation in thymectomy?,To avoid loss of pneumothorax pressure and maintain proper exposure; opening the right pleural space is only necessary at the end for harvesting the right cardiophrenic fat pad.
Extended Thymectomy for Myasthenia Gravis and Thymoma,What is the safe CO2 insufflation pressure range for thymectomy in most patients?,CO2 insufflation at a pressure range of 8-10 mm Hg is generally considered safe for the majority of patients undergoing robotic-assisted thymectomy. This pressure allows for adequate expansion of the operative field without causing significant hemodynamic compromise in normovolemic individuals with preserved cardiac function.
Extended Thymectomy for Myasthenia Gravis and Thymoma,Which patients need extra caution during CO2 insufflation in thymectomy due to hemodynamic risks?,Patients who are hypovolemic or have poor left ventricular function are more sensitive to changes in intrathoracic pressure and may experience unstable blood pressure or low cardiac output.
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,What instruments are necessary for a robotic Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy?,"The essential robotic instruments for a Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy include a 30 degrees scope, Maryland and fenestrated bipolar forceps, Cadiere forceps, vessel sealer, EndoWrist suction irrigator, monopolar cautery hook, clip appliers (small and medium-large), a large suture-cut needle driver, and two large needle drivers."
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,Why is lymph node dissection along the recurrent laryngeal nerves critical in Radical Esophagectomy?,"Because these are common sites of metastasis, especially in squamous cell carcinoma, and complete dissection improves prognosis."
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,How can mediastinal lymph node dissection be performed safely during Radical Esophagectomy ?,"By following the outermost layer-oriented approach, staying superficial to the autonomic nerves to avoid nerve injury."
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,What are the indications for performing radical esophagectomy (RE)?,"Robotic esophagectomy is currently indicated for most operable patients with resectable esophageal cancer, including those with locally advanced disease."
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,What conditions should be excluded from the indications for radical esophagectomy (RE) in patients with esophageal cancer?,"Contraindications for robotic esophagectomy include clinical T4 tumors, severe intrathoracic adhesions, and failure of one-lung ventilation."
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,What tools are used to mobilize the medial aspect of the lymphatic chain in radical esophagectomy?,Intermittent intraoperative neuromonitoring and yellow Vessel Loops for marking the cranial margin of station 101L.
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,How is trocar placement planned using anatomical landmarks in Radical Esophagectomy?,The trocar placement is planned by marking the center of the parallelogram formed by the subscapular angle line (SAL) and the anterior axillary line (AAL) between the 2nd and 12th ribs as 'S' (scope).
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,What is the minimum distance required between each trocar in the Radical Esophagectomy procedure?,The minimum distance between each trocar must be longer than 7 cm.
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,What is done after completing the thoracic stage of the Radical Esophagectomy procedure?,"The patient is turned back to the supine position, and robotic stomach mobilization is performed."
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,"In the Radical Esophagectomy,how many robotic and assistant ports are placed in the upper abdomen, and where?","Three 8-mm da Vinci trocars (R1, R2, R3) and one 12-mm assistant port (A1) are placed in a straight line across the upper abdomen."
Radical Esophagectomy with Extended Mediastinal Lymphadenectomy,What type and size of stapler are used for the end-to-side anastomosis in radical esophagectomy?,"An end-to-side anastomosis is performed using a circular stapler, either 25 mm or 21 mm in size."
Splenectomy,What are the indications for splenectomy?,"Splenectomy indications can be categorized into two primary groups: (1) procedures performed for diagnostic purposes and (2) surgeries conducted to treat a disease. In the first category, splenectomy is typically performed to evaluate the presence of subdiaphragmatic extension of Hodgkin lymphoma or to investigate the nature of a splenic lesion, such as a cyst, abscess, or benign or malignant tumor. When splenectomy is carried out as a treatment for a disease, it is typically done to alleviate symptomatic splenomegaly, prevent the risk of splenic rupture (as in the case of infectious mononucleosis), address hypersplenism (due to hematologic disorders), or remove focal pathology."
Splenectomy,What are the relative contraindications for performing splenectomy?,"Relative contraindications for splenectomy include large splenomegaly (greater than 20 cm), a hostile abdomen, portal hypertension, and hemodynamically unstable patients. When assessing the indications for the procedure, several factors should be considered: the experience of the surgical team, whether the specific disease or indication increases the risk of intraperitoneal rupture, and the strategy for organ extraction."
Splenectomy,How is pneumoperitoneum achieved in case of splenomegaly during Splenectomy?,"In cases of splenomegaly, pneumoperitoneum is achieved with the Veress needle technique, and the needle can be placed below the umbilicus."
Splenectomy,"What potential complication can occur during colonic flexure mobilization in splenectomy, and why is careful retraction required?","Laceration of the splenic capsule. In this step, careful retraction is essential to prevent tension on any potential adhesions between the omentum and the spleen, as this could lead to lacerations of the splenic capsule and result in bleeding."
Splenectomy,What is the proper technique for controlling the splenic artery during splenectomy?,"The proper technique for controlling the splenic artery involves selecting the most distal portion of the artery that is easily identifiable for preliminary control. A careful dissection is performed along the artery using a monopolar hook at a right angle, and a vessel loop is placed around the artery to allow better manipulation, retraction, and potential clamping."
Splenectomy,What anatomical challenges should be considered during the splenic artery control?,"Anatomical challenges include the splenic artery being kinked, tortuous, and potentially disappearing behind the pancreatic tail, which can complicate the procedure."
Splenectomy,What is a complication that can occur during the taking down of the phrenogastric and phrenosplenic ligaments with partial mobilization of the spleen (step 5)?,The opening of the diaphragm and left pleura.
Splenectomy,How is the splenic hilum prepared for transection in splenectomy?,"When preparing the splenic hilum for transection, the lower and upper pole branches of the splenic artery and vein are typically ligated and divided individually (using Prolene (TM) 4/0 sutures). In some cases, an upper pole artery originating from the posterior gastric artery or the splenic artery may be encountered and must be divided. This step narrows the hilum, making it easier to staple without including pancreatic tissue, thus preventing injury to the pancreas."
Splenectomy,How do you control the splenic artery during splenectomy if initial control is too distal or too proximal?,"If the preliminary control of the splenic artery was performed very distally, close to the hilum, the artery can be divided at that level using a vascular stapler. However, if the control was too proximal, a bulldog clamp can be applied to reduce splenic inflow without dividing the artery. Once this is done, a stapler is inserted toward the splenic side of the hilum, and the partial mobilization of the spleen helps facilitate this maneuver. Both the artery and vein are then divided simultaneously using the stapler."
Splenectomy,What are the main causes of recurrent disease or splenosis after splenectomy?,"Severe perisplenitis: in cases of severe perisplenitis, splenic tissue may unintentionally remain behind, along with patches of thickened capsule. The remaining tissue can gradually increase in size over time. Splenic rupture during extraction or morselization: There is a risk of breaking the spleen during the extraction process or when morselizing the tissue. Overlooking accessory spleens: Failing to recognize the presence of accessory spleens can lead to incomplete removal of splenic tissue."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,How are the robotic cannulas and the endoscope placed for pancreaticoduodenectomy?,"The standard setup includes six cannulas: four 8-mm robotic ports and two 10-12-mm assistant ports. The robotic ports are aligned in a straight line, approximately 2 cm above the transverse umbilical line. The camera is usually placed in the right paraumbilical port to offer the best view of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and the right side of the portal vein. The assistant ports are located in the lower quadrants on either side of the midline, spaced apart to enable smooth assistant interaction without crowding the robotic arms."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,What needs to be considered when planning pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) during division of the gastrocolic ligament?,"When performing a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), it is crucial to preserve the right gastroepiploic arcade to ensure adequate blood flow to the pylorus and maintain its function."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,What is the Kocher maneuver in pancreaticoduodenectomy and why is it significant?,"The Kocher maneuver involves the complete mobilization of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas by detaching them from the retroperitoneum. In the Whipple procedure, this step is essential for proper cancer staging, assessing the anatomical resectability of the tumor, and facilitating the dissection of the uncinate process in a safer and more controlled manner. The maneuver begins by incising the peritoneal reflection near the Winslow foramen, just lateral to the second portion of the duodenum. In minimally invasive approaches like laparoscopic or robotic surgery, the Kocher maneuver should be performed even more extensively than in open surgery, to fully expose critical structures such as the inferior vena cava, the left side of the aorta, the left renal vein, and the origin of the superior mesenteric artery."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,What are the main objectives of the hepatic hilum dissection and station 12 lymphadenectomy during a pancreaticoduodenectomy?,"The dissection of the hepatic hilum and hepatoduodenal ligament serves three key purposes: to evaluate for oncological signs such as carcinomatosis or extensive lymphatic spread, to perform a lymphadenectomy of station 12 lymph nodes, and to assess the vascular anatomy with precision. Identification of a 'frozen' hilum is considered a contraindication to proceeding with resection."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,What are the common anatomical origins of the right gastric artery in pancreaticoduodenectomy?,"The right gastric artery most commonly originates from the proper hepatic artery in over 50% of patients. In about 20% of cases, it arises from the common hepatic artery. Less frequently, it can originate from the left hepatic artery or the gastroduodenal artery."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,Why is cholecystectomy a necessary step during the Whipple procedure?,"Cholecystectomy is an essential part of the Whipple procedure because preserving the gallbladder in the presence of a bilioenteric anastomosis can lead to recurrent infections. The altered bile flow and potential for stasis increase the risk of cholangitis and gallbladder-related complications. In addition, taking down the gallbladder anterogradely opens the space in the hilum and facilitates the lymphadenectomy of the hepatoduodenal ligament."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,What are the key steps and challenges in dissecting the uncinate process during the Whipple procedure?,"The uncinate process dissection is one of the most complex and critical stages of the Whipple procedure, with a high risk of severe intraoperative bleeding complications. The dissection begins with the stable and progressive lateral lifting with R3 of the pancreatic head, which helps open the groove between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and the uncinate process with its vascular connections. First, the venous Henle's trunk, which connects the right lateral side of the pancreatic neck to the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), should be divided using Prolene (TM) 4/0 or 5/0 sutures. This step is crucial as it provides complete exposure of the uncinate process behind the SMV. The dissection then continues from ventral to cephalad, with the goal of exposing the anterior, safe aspect of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) by working on the left side of the SMV (artery first). This maneuver may require ligating some branches of the SMV, including, at times, the middle colic vein. Exposing the SMA serves as an important anatomical landmark for the dissection. A careful inspection of the posterior face of the SMV reveals the posterior branches, particularly the pancreaticojejunal trunk. Once the anatomy is well understood, a right-angle hook is used to create a window, and a vessel loop is passed around the SMV, facilitated by the 'hanging maneuver.' Careful traction on the vessel loop by the assistant enhances control over the lower corner of the uncinate process, where the pancreaticojejunal trunk is located. Suture ligation of this trunk with Prolene (TM) 4/0 is typically possible. Detaching the lower corner opens the groove between the uncinate process and the SMA. The arterial branches from the SMA to the ventral pancreas can vary, but the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is the most consistent and crucial vessel. This large branch can be ligated or clipped and then sutured. If there are no oncological concerns, dissection can be performed in the connective tissue just lateral to the SMA, leaving some tissue around the artery. In this case, Harmonic shears or a vessel sealer can be used to divide the arterial branches within the tissue, with suture reinforcement recommended. The final vessel to be divided (clipped or sutured) is the superior pancreaticoduodenal vein, located on the upper right side of the portal vein."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,When is an end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy preferred during the Whipple procedure?,"An end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy is preferred when the quality of the pancreatic tissue is not too friable, and the pancreatic duct is larger than 3-4 mm. This technique offers a mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis and is advantageous because it does not require extensive mobilization of the pancreatic stump."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,What complications can arise from including the pancreatic duct in the posterior suture during pancreaticojejunostomy?,"Inadvertently including the pancreatic duct in the posterior suture during a pancreaticojejunostomy can lead to severe complications, such as pancreatitis and an anastomotic leak. This is because the sutures may constrict or damage the duct, disrupting normal pancreatic drainage. Additionally, a loose posterior running or anchoring suture can result in a side branch pancreatic leak, which is a common cause of type A leaks following the procedure. These leaks can lead to significant postoperative morbidity, including infection or abscess formation, making it crucial to ensure proper suture tension and alignment during the anastomosis."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,What steps are taken after the construction of the posterior anchoring suture in pancreaticoduodenectomy?,"After constructing the posterior anchoring suture in a pancreaticojejunostomy, it is crucial to verify that the pancreatic juice is naturally flowing out of the stent. This step ensures that the anastomosis is functioning properly and that there is no obstruction in the pancreatic duct. If the pancreatic parenchyma is fragile, an alternative to the posterior running suture is the use of Blumgart-type anchoring stitches. These stitches are designed to provide additional support to the anastomosis, especially in cases where the pancreatic tissue is weak or friable, ensuring a more secure and durable connection between the pancreas and the jejunum."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,How is the transgastric pancreaticogastrostomy performed during pancreaticoduodenectomy?,"The pancreatic stump must first be mobilized. At least 4-5 cm of the pancreatic body is skeletonized, and all arterial and venous connections with the splenic vessels are divided using Prolene (TM) 5/0 sutures. Two stay sutures of Prolene (TM) 2/0 are placed at the upper and lower margins of the pancreatic stump to help with positioning. A small opening is then created in the posterior gastric wall, where the pancreatic stump naturally rests without tension. A longitudinal vertical anterior gastrotomy is made near this posterior opening, allowing the pancreas to be gently pulled into the stomach, achieving full invagination of the stump. To secure the pancreas to the gastric wall, interrupted stitches of Prolene (TM) 4/0 are placed inside the stomach, fixing the pancreatic capsule. Perfect hemostasis is crucial, and any minor bleeding is controlled with additional Prolene (TM) 4/0 sutures. Once the anastomosis is complete, the anterior gastrostomy is closed with a running suture of Prolene (TM) 3/0."
Pancreaticoduodenectomy,Where is the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis located in pancreaticoduodenectomy?,"The hepaticojejunostomy is an end-to-side biliodigestive reconstruction performed 20-30 cm distal to the pancreaticojejunostomy, using the same jejunal loop as the anastomotic site."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,What is the Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy procedure for pancreatic cancer?,"The RAMPS (Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy) procedure, introduced in 2003, is a surgical approach used for cancers located in the body and tail of the pancreas. It involves a right-to-left antegrade dissection with early control of major vessels such as the splenic artery and vein, celiac artery, and superior mesenteric artery (SMA)."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,Why is the Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy considered modular?,"The procedure is considered 'modular' because the posterior dissection can be tailored based on tumor involvement, either anterior to the adrenal gland and Gerota's fascia (anterior RAMPS) or posterior to these structures (posterior RAMPS)."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,What is the purpose of dissecting the retrogastric adhesions with the pancreas while moving toward the posterior wall of the gastric antrum in radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy?,"Dissection of the pancreatic neck allows evaluation of tumor involvement of the SMV or portal vein. It is critical for assessing resectability, especially for detecting tangential abutment or encasement of vascular structures."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,What needs to be done with the short gastric vessels when left-sided portal hypertension is present during radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy?,"Short gastric vessels are divided using a vessel sealer with dual application for hemostasis, while the R3 arm provides dynamic stomach retraction. If left-sided portal hypertension is present, the splenic artery should be divided first via stapler or Prolene 3/0 suture to reduce backflow bleeding before addressing congested vessels."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,In what ways is the pancreas transected during division of the pancreas in RAMPS?,"Transection is done with either Harmonic shears or a triple-row stapler, depending on gland texture, thickness, and surgeon preference. If feasible, a vessel loop is passed under a retropancreatic tunnel to elevate the neck. In cases of inflammation or venous invasion, layer-by-layer Harmonic dissection in antegrade fashion is safer. The main duct is identified by clear pancreatic juice and secured with a figure-8 Prolene 3-0/4-0 suture."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,What surgical steps are taken if the portal vein is invaded by the tumor in Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy?,"If portal vein invasion is confirmed, segmental resection and reconstruction of the vein are performed to achieve an R0 resection."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,How is the lymphadenectomy around the SMA performed in RAMPS?,"The dissection starts from the middle colic artery and proceeds along the SMA. Once the anterior aortic border is reached, the dissection moves posteriorly along both sides of the aorta toward the diaphragm, dividing the tissue over the aorta, IVC, and left renal vein."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,"What steps are required prior to removing the distal pancreas, the adrenal gland, and all the retroperitoneal fat in radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy?","The adrenal vein is divided at its junction with the renal vein, then dissection continues posterior to the adrenal, behind Gerota's fascia, down to the kidney capsule. The adrenal gland, distal pancreas, and retroperitoneal fat are removed en bloc."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,What steps are required if the tumor infiltrates the middle colic artery and transverse mesocolon in Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy?,"The infiltrated segment of the middle colic artery and transverse mesocolon must be resected. Interaortocaval lymphadenectomy is routinely performed, and optimal exposure of the SMA may require the hanging maneuver with skilled assistance."
Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy,What are the borders for retroperitoneal dissection in RAMPS when the tumor infiltrates the middle colic artery and the transverse mesocolon?,The dissection is bounded superiorly by the diaphragm and inferiorly by the left renal vein. Full exposure of the aorta and inferior vena cava is achieved within this plane.
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,"What are the two main techniques for spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, and how do they differ?","The two primary techniques are the Kimura technique, which preserves the splenic vessels, and the Warshaw technique, which involves transection of the splenic artery and vein while preserving the short gastric vessels for splenic perfusion. The Kimura method is more technically demanding but avoids the higher risk of splenic infarction and perigastric varices seen with the Warshaw technique."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,How does the robotic approach improve outcomes in spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy compared to laparoscopy and open surgery?,"The robotic approach offers enhanced microdissection and superior 3D visualization, enabling better preservation of the splenic vessels (especially in Kimura cases). This leads to higher spleen preservation rates, fewer conversions to open surgery, and reduced hospital stays compared to traditional laparoscopic or open methods."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,What are the indications for spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?,"Indications include benign or low-grade malignant lesions in the pancreatic body and tail, such as G1-G2 pNETs (<3-4 cm), mucinous cystadenomas without malignancy signs (<5 cm, absence of thickened, irregular, or calcified walls), non-invasive symptomatic IPMNs without high-risk features, symptomatic serous cystadenomas, and selected cases of chronic pancreatitis predominantly confined to the body and tail of the pancreas (refractory pseudocysts after failed drainage) or solid pseudopapillary tumors."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,What should be performed for patients with pNETs or IPMNs during spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?,"In patients with pNETs or IPMNs, regional lymph node sampling is essential to ensure accurate staging if malignancy is confirmed after surgery. For confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma, distal splenopancreatectomy with formal regional or radical lymphadenectomy remains the standard of care."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,How is the splenic artery dissected and prepared during spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?,"The splenic artery is dissected at its origin using a monopolar hook as a right-angle instrument. A vessel loop is placed around the artery to aid in manipulation, retraction, and possible clamping."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,"What is a common mistake during splenic artery dissection in spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, and how can it be prevented?","The splenic artery may be misidentified as the common hepatic artery, especially in the presence of bulky retroperitoneal tissue or unusual arterial anatomy. Identifying the celiac trunk by tracing the left gastric artery can help correctly differentiate between the two arteries and prevent critical errors."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,"At what point during spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) used, and for what purpose?","An IOUS is recommended when the lesion is not clearly visible on the pancreatic capsule to better define its location, margins, and proximity to major vessels."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,How does the location of the lesion affect the dissection strategy in spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?,"For small lesions in the tail, a parenchymal-sparing lateral-to-medial approach is preferred; for proximal body lesions, a medial-to-lateral approach with neck division is indicated."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,Are the short gastric vessels typically preserved during opening of the gastrocolic ligament in spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?,"Yes, they are usually preserved, but may be sacrificed in select cases to improve exposure or reduce bleeding risk during difficult splenic vessel dissection."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,How is the pancreatic body and tail mobilized in spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?,"Two Prolene (TM) 2/0 sutures are applied to the distal section line of the pancreatic body to facilitate traction. A meticulous dissection is done to separate the pancreas from the splenic vessels, often adjusting the dissection angle due to arterial kinkings. Small branches can be divided in between sutures of Prolene (TM) 5/0 or 6/0."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,Why are Harmonic shears preferred for transecting a thick and soft pancreas during spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?,"Harmonic shears are used to avoid the 'crushing effect' of the stapler, which could damage the tissue in a thick and soft pancreas."
Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy,What is the preferred approach for dissecting very distal lesions in spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy?,"For very distal lesions, a lateral-to-medial approach is preferred. The dissection starts from the tail of the pancreas, with Prolene (TM) 2/0 stay sutures placed for medial retraction, carefully separating the parenchyma from the splenic hilum, and proceeding until a safe resection margin is reached."
Central Pancreatectomy,What is central pancreatectomy (CP) and what are its advantages?,"Central pancreatectomy involves the limited resection of the middle segment of the pancreas, preserving more functional parenchyma. This reduces the risk of exocrine and endocrine insufficiency and avoids unnecessary organ mutilation, such as the spleen, seen in distal splenopancreatectomies. These advantages can lead to better clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients."
Central Pancreatectomy,What are the three factors that limit the widespread adoption of the central pancreatectomy (CP)?,"The challenges include the technical difficulty of dissection and reconstruction, which requires microsurgical skills due to the complex anatomy around the pancreas. Additionally, CP is not suitable for cancer operations due to the limited resection and lack of lymphadenectomy. Another major limitation is the higher risk of pancreatic fistula compared to other standard pancreatic resections."
Central Pancreatectomy,When is better exposure of the pancreatic head required during a central pancreatectomy?,"Better exposure of the pancreatic head is needed when the potential proximal margins extend on the right side of the portal vein. In such cases, mobilizing the right colonic flexure and performing a Kocher maneuver may be necessary to achieve optimal exposure."
Central Pancreatectomy,How is the pancreatic neck prepared during central pancreatectomy?,"The pancreatic neck is prepared by first dissecting the peritoneal reflection between the mesocolon and the inferior border of the pancreas using a monopolar hook. This creates initial exposure of the pancreatic isthmus and the superior mesenteric vein. In cases of a thick colonic mesentery, following the middle colic vein helps identify its merging with the superior mesenteric vein or the mesentericoportal junction. An initial, partial retropancreatic tunnel is then created between the inferior edge of the pancreatic neck and the mesentericoportal axis."
Central Pancreatectomy,How are the main peripancreatic arteries prepared during central pancreatectomy?,"The preparation involves a careful dissection of the superior border of the pancreatic neck to expose the proximal common hepatic artery, extending along the major vascular axis to the gastroduodenal artery, which represents the proximal pancreatic resection limit. The progressive mobilization of the superior pancreatic edge may facilitate the identification of the left gastric vein, reducing the risk of its inadvertent injury during the subsequent retropancreatic dissection. The splenic artery is also prepared, encircled with a vessel loop for retraction. This allows for precise mobilization of the vessels without injury."
Central Pancreatectomy,What is the ultimate goal of peripancreatic vascular dissection during central pancreatectomy?,"The ultimate goal is to create a safe space between the pancreatic gland and the main vessels, allowing for a less risky parenchymal transection. This careful dissection minimizes the risk of injury to vital structures during the procedure."
Central Pancreatectomy,How is the retropancreatic tunnel completed during central pancreatectomy?,"The retropancreatic tunnel is completed using a careful blunt dissection technique between the posterior surface of the pancreas and the mesenteric-portal axis. With the grasper stable in the R3 retracting the stomach, a monopolar cautery hook in the R1 and a bipolar grasper in the R2, the retropancreatic dissection is performed."
Central Pancreatectomy,How does the hanging maneuver facilitate parenchymal transection during central pancreatectomy?,"The 'hanging maneuver' involves placing a vessel loop to lift the pancreas away from the portal vein, which provides better access for parenchymal transection and reduces the risk of injury to nearby vessels."
Central Pancreatectomy,How does the location of the tumor affect the order of pancreatic transection during central pancreatectomy?,"If the tumor is located in the pancreatic body, the pancreatic neck is divided first, followed by the preparation of the distal portion. If the tumor is in the neck, the pancreatic body is divided first, and the proximal stump is retracted to the right side to achieve proper margins."
Central Pancreatectomy,Why is an intraoperative frozen section analysis performed before reconstruction in central pancreatectomy?,"Intraoperative frozen section analysis is performed before reconstruction to evaluate the proximal and distal margins, especially when the lesion is close to the section line, ensuring clear margins for oncological safety."
Central Pancreatectomy,How is the Roux-en-Y jejunal loop prepared during central pancreatectomy reconstruction?,The second jejunal loop is divided about 30 cm from the Treitz ligament using a vessel sealer for the mesentery and a linear stapler. A side-to-side jejunojejunostomy is distally performed to create a 60 cm isolated loop. The anastomosis is carried out with a stapling technique.
Central Pancreatectomy,"When is the pancreatic duct stented before starting the reconstructive phase of central pancreatectomy, and why?","The pancreatic duct is stented with a small cannula when it is less than 3-4 mm in size to ensure proper drainage and facilitate anastomosis, with the cannula being secured using a 4/0 absorbable monofilament suture."
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,What is the main advantage of enucleation over traditional pancreatic resections like PD or LP?,"Enucleation spares normal pancreatic tissue, reducing the risk of endocrine and exocrine insufficiency compared to major resections that remove large amounts of healthy parenchyma."
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,"What is the most common complication following pancreatic enucleation, and what factors influence its risk?","Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), similar to standard pancreatic resections, is the most common complication, with higher risk in tumors located near the main pancreatic ducts, particularly in the ventral head parenchyma and uncinate process."
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,What are ideal tumor characteristics for considering enucleation in pNETs?,"Ideal pNETs for enucleation are smaller than 2-3 cm, have a Ki67 index <3% (G1), and are located more than 3 mm away from the main or accessory pancreatic duct."
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,What imaging modalities are typically included in the preoperative workup for pancreatic lesions?,"Triple-phase contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) are routinely used."
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,What are the main indications for pancreatic enucleation?,"Small nonfunctional pNETs <2 cm with low Ki-67 index and located >3 mm from the main or accessory pancreatic duct; small functional pNETs as insulinomas and gastrinomas <2 cm that are >3 mm from the pancreatic duct are suitable for enucleation. For larger tumors with a higher risk of malignancy or possible lymph node involvement, standard pancreatectomy with lymphadenectomy is recommended."
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,How does fluorescence imaging aid in pancreatic enucleation?,"Fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) can help visualize small and superficial pNETs, aiding in their accurate localization and safe resection."
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,"When should preoperative insertion of a temporary endoscopic stent be considered, and why?","Lesions close to the Wirsung duct carry a high risk of accidental duct injury during enucleation, which increases the likelihood of postoperative pancreatic fistula. A temporary endoscopic stent can help identify and protect the duct, reducing this risk."
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,What instruments and energy settings are preferred during tumor dissection in enucleation?,Monopolar (hook or scissors) and bipolar Maryland forceps are preferred. Monopolar energy should be kept at the lowest effective setting to avoid thermal injury or tissue charring.
Enucleation of Pancreatic Tumors,What should surgeons pay attention to during tumor manipulation in pancreatic enucleation?,"Great care must be taken to avoid accidental rupture of the tumor capsule. The tumor should not be grabbed directly; instead, gentle traction or pushing with a sponge is recommended to safely mobilize the tumor."

This makes possible an 'open-like' technique: the dissection is usually started with the mobilization of the mesentery. The detachment of the mesentery of the right colon from the retroperitoneum facilitates, even in thick/obese patients, the identification of the vascular pedicles and of the main superior mesenteric trunks. The dissection starts at the cecal base, moving cranially up to the right flexure, while the R3 is counter retracting the colon medially."

Left Colectomy,Why is the mobilization of the splenic flexure a critical technical aspect in left colectomy?,"1. It provides a well-perfused, longer, proximal colonic segment, which allows a floppy anastomosis. 2. If the mobilization of the splenic flexure is not performed preventively, and the proximal colon becomes too short, going back for further mobilization of the flexure can be very difficult (mainly if the anastomosis was already done), and the blood flow of the marginal arcade can be compromised. 3. It permits a wider oncological dissection with easier lymphadenectomy. 4. It allows the mastering of a surgical maneuver that, similarly to the Kocher maneuver in hepatopancreatobiliary surgery, can be used in other/different operations (e.g., distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy). Some authors claim potential drawbacks connected to the routine splenic flexure mobilization, such as (1) risk of splenic injuries and (2) extended operative time. However, in expert hands, such occurrences are rare."

Medial to lateral dissection. 3. Top-down dissection with omental colonic detachment. 4. Top-down approach with opening of the gastrocolic ligament (trans gastrocolic access). If there are adhesions, diverticulitis, or the presence of many diverticula, the omental detachment can be dangerous. In this case, the omentum may be left attached to the colon, and the gastrocolic ligament is divided with an omental flap adherent to the flexure. In this approach, the left colonic flexure is taken down with the omentum attached."
Left Colectomy,Where is the most favorable site to begin lateral-to-medial dissection of the left colonic flexure in left colectomy?,The most favorable point to start the lateral-to-medial dissection is 5–6 cm below the left colonic flexure.

Total Mesorectal Excision of Rectal Cancer,What is the first measure to manage an injury to the presacral vein during total mesorectal excision?,"Entering into a deeper space, below the endopelvic fascia, and damaging the presacral veins. These veins can bleed massively and be difficult to control. Compression with a sponge and hemostatic agent is the first measure to adopt in such an event. Bipolar coagulation may be ineffective or cause more bleeding, and suturing with Dacron® pledgets on the periosteum is challenging."
Total Mesorectal Excision of Rectal Cancer,"What technique, developed by Kyungpook National University, is effective for deep posterior rectal dissection in total mesorectal excision, and what are its key features?","A very useful technique developed by Kyungpook National University for deep posterior dissection of the rectum is to use a tip-up fenestrated grasper in R3 to lift up the mesorectum and to provide a clear surgical field between the rectum and sacrum. This maneuver enables the surgeon to use both hands to facilitate fine dissection around the last part of the rectum, even to be able to enter into the intersphincteric space."
