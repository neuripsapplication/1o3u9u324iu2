Central Pancreatectomy,What is central pancreatectomy (CP) and what are its advantages?,"Central pancreatectomy involves the limited resection of the middle segment of the pancreas, preserving more functional parenchyma. This reduces the risk of exocrine and endocrine insufficiency and avoids unnecessary organ mutilation, such as the spleen, seen in distal splenopancreatectomies. These advantages can lead to better clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients."
Central Pancreatectomy,What are the three factors that limit the widespread adoption of the central pancreatectomy (CP)?,"The challenges include the technical difficulty of dissection and reconstruction, which requires microsurgical skills due to the complex anatomy around the pancreas. Additionally, CP is not suitable for cancer operations due to the limited resection and lack of lymphadenectomy. Another major limitation is the higher risk of pancreatic fistula compared to other standard pancreatic resections."
Central Pancreatectomy,When is better exposure of the pancreatic head required during a central pancreatectomy?,"Better exposure of the pancreatic head is needed when the potential proximal margins extend on the right side of the portal vein. In such cases, mobilizing the right colonic flexure and performing a Kocher maneuver may be necessary to achieve optimal exposure."
Central Pancreatectomy,How is the pancreatic neck prepared during central pancreatectomy?,"The pancreatic neck is prepared by first dissecting the peritoneal reflection between the mesocolon and the inferior border of the pancreas using a monopolar hook. This creates initial exposure of the pancreatic isthmus and the superior mesenteric vein. In cases of a thick colonic mesentery, following the middle colic vein helps identify its merging with the superior mesenteric vein or the mesentericoportal junction. An initial, partial retropancreatic tunnel is then created between the inferior edge of the pancreatic neck and the mesentericoportal axis."
Central Pancreatectomy,How are the main peripancreatic arteries prepared during central pancreatectomy?,"The preparation involves a careful dissection of the superior border of the pancreatic neck to expose the proximal common hepatic artery, extending along the major vascular axis to the gastroduodenal artery, which represents the proximal pancreatic resection limit. The progressive mobilization of the superior pancreatic edge may facilitate the identification of the left gastric vein, reducing the risk of its inadvertent injury during the subsequent retropancreatic dissection. The splenic artery is also prepared, encircled with a vessel loop for retraction. This allows for precise mobilization of the vessels without injury."
Central Pancreatectomy,What is the ultimate goal of peripancreatic vascular dissection during central pancreatectomy?,"The ultimate goal is to create a safe space between the pancreatic gland and the main vessels, allowing for a less risky parenchymal transection. This careful dissection minimizes the risk of injury to vital structures during the procedure."
Central Pancreatectomy,How is the retropancreatic tunnel completed during central pancreatectomy?,"The retropancreatic tunnel is completed using a careful blunt dissection technique between the posterior surface of the pancreas and the mesenteric-portal axis. With the grasper stable in the R3 retracting the stomach, a monopolar cautery hook in the R1 and a bipolar grasper in the R2, the retropancreatic dissection is performed."
Central Pancreatectomy,How does the hanging maneuver facilitate parenchymal transection during central pancreatectomy?,"The 'hanging maneuver' involves placing a vessel loop to lift the pancreas away from the portal vein, which provides better access for parenchymal transection and reduces the risk of injury to nearby vessels."
Central Pancreatectomy,How does the location of the tumor affect the order of pancreatic transection during central pancreatectomy?,"If the tumor is located in the pancreatic body, the pancreatic neck is divided first, followed by the preparation of the distal portion. If the tumor is in the neck, the pancreatic body is divided first, and the proximal stump is retracted to the right side to achieve proper margins."
Central Pancreatectomy,Why is an intraoperative frozen section analysis performed before reconstruction in central pancreatectomy?,"Intraoperative frozen section analysis is performed before reconstruction to evaluate the proximal and distal margins, especially when the lesion is close to the section line, ensuring clear margins for oncological safety."
Central Pancreatectomy,How is the Roux-en-Y jejunal loop prepared during central pancreatectomy reconstruction?,The second jejunal loop is divided about 30 cm from the Treitz ligament using a vessel sealer for the mesentery and a linear stapler. A side-to-side jejunojejunostomy is distally performed to create a 60 cm isolated loop. The anastomosis is carried out with a stapling technique.
Central Pancreatectomy,"When is the pancreatic duct stented before starting the reconstructive phase of central pancreatectomy, and why?","The pancreatic duct is stented with a small cannula when it is less than 3-4 mm in size to ensure proper drainage and facilitate anastomosis, with the cannula being secured using a 4/0 absorbable monofilament suture."
