Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass,What are the two mechanisms of action of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?,It restricts the amount of food that the stomach can hold and decreases the absorption of nutrients.," The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has two primary mechanisms of action:
1. It restricts the amount of food that the stomach can hold.
2. It decreases the absorption of nutrients.","['INTRODUCTION\n\nRouxenY gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most popular procedures for achieving longterm weight loss and resolution of obesityrelated comorbidities. This procedure has been modified over several decades to its current version. RYGB has a dual mechanism of action: it restricts the amount of food that the stomach can hold and decreases the absorption of nutrients. Moreover, other proposed mechanisms have been described, such as changes in gut hormones (that reduce appetite and enhance satiety), gut microbiota, bile acids metabolism, and energy expenditure. Minimally invasive RYGB can achieve significant and sustained weight loss with low postoperative morbidity and mortality rates.']"
Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass,Why is the robotic platform useful in superobese patients in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?,It eliminates the abdominal wall torque effect.," The robotic platform is useful in superobese patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass because it eliminates the abdominal wall torque effect. This means that it allows for a smoother surgical process even in patients with excessive body weight, which can otherwise cause difficulties due to the strain on the surgeon's hands and tools. Additionally, the platform's articulated instruments and enhanced suturing capabilities can help with staple line reinforcement, bleeding control, and mesenteric gap closure, all of which can be particularly challenging in superobese patients.","['The robotic platform might offer several advantages during RYGB. The stability of the platform, along with its articulated instruments, make seamless handsewn anastomosis creation much easier. This enhanced suturing capability can also be used for staple line reinforcement, bleeding control, and mesenteric gap closure. Moreover, the robotic platform is especially useful in superobese patients (eliminating the abdominal wall torque effect) and revisional bariatric cases where dense adhesions and altered anatomy are commonly encountered. In this chapter, the technical description of primary robotic RYGB will be detailed.\n\nIndications and Relative Contraindications to the Robotic Approach\n\nCandidates for RYGB should meet the following criteria: BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 and two or more obesityrelated comorbidities, and inability to achieve sustained weight loss for a significant period with prior weight loss efforts.']"

Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass,What are the relative contraindications for a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?,"Severe portal hypertension, dependency on alcohol/drugs, immunosuppression, and intellectual impairment."," The relative contraindications for a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass include severe portal hypertension, dependency on alcohol/drugs, immunosuppression, and intellectual impairment. Additionally, special consideration should be taken for patients with Crohn's disease due to the increased risk for complications.","['Although these indications apply to many different metabolic procedures, the decision for the appropriate operation should consider the patient’s characteristics, needs/preference, and surgeon’s experience. There are no absolute contraindications for robotic RYGB. The relative contraindications are the same as per the laparoscopic RYGB: severe portal hypertension, dependency on alcohol/drugs, immunosuppression, and intellectual impairment.

Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass,What is the key to avoiding anastomotic complications in a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass?,The key to avoiding anastomotic complications is to create a well-perfused and tension-free gastrojejunal anastomosis.," The key to avoiding anastomotic complications in a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is creating a well-perfused and tension-free gastrojejunal anastomosis.

Preparation of the pancreatic neck\n\nOnce the ultrasonographic evaluation of the pancreatic gland is completed, the peritoneal reflection between the mesocolon and the inferior border of the pancreas is carefully dissected with the monopolar hook. This maneuver allows an initial exposure of the pancreatic isthmus and of the underlying superior mesenteric vein. In presence of a thick colonic mesentery, following the middle colic vein may facilitate the finding of its merging into the superior mesenteric vein or the mesentericoportal junction.', 'INTRODUCTION\n\nCentral pancreatectomy (CP) involves a limited resection of the middle segment of the pancreas. As a tissuesparing procedure, it allows preservation of more functional parenchyma, decreasing the risk of exocrine and/or endocrine insufficiency, and also avoids the unnecessary mutilation of organs such as the spleen as in distal splenopancreatectomies.

There are 3 factors that limit a wide adoption of the technique, which was first described in open surgery in 1957 by\n\nGuillemin and Bessot with a double anastomosis:\n\nThe technical challenge of the dissection and reconstruction requires microsurgical skills. The neck of the pancreas lays on top of a crossway of important vessels.\n\nThe contained resection and lymphadenectomy do not qualify the procedure as a cancer operation and the indications should be carefully selected.', 'An initial, partial retropancreatic tunnel is then created between the inferior edge of the pancreatic neck and the mesentericoportal axis.

Central Pancreatectomy,How are the main peripancreatic arteries prepared during central pancreatectomy?,"The preparation involves a careful dissection of the superior border of the pancreatic neck to expose the proximal common hepatic artery, extending along the major vascular axis to the gastroduodenal artery, which represents the proximal pancreatic resection limit.

The splenic artery is also prepared, encircled with a vessel loop for retraction. This allows for precise mobilization of the vessels without injury."," During central pancreatectomy, the main peripancreatic arteries are prepared by performing a periadventitial vascular dissection. This involves detaching the lymph nodes that accompany the main arteries, such as the common hepatic artery, gastroduodenal artery, and splenic artery. The lymph node sampling helps in completing the oncological procedure, especially for low-grade pNETs. The vessels are skeletonized during this process, providing a safe space between the pancreatic gland and the main vessels, which facilitates a less risky parenchymal transection.","['Step 4.
